# Clustering & Classification Analysis on Iris and Wine Datasets

This project involves a comparative analysis of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms on classic datasets (**Iris** and **Wine**) within the scope of machine learning fundamentals.

# Project Objective
To analyze datasets by revealing clustering patterns using **K-Means** and testing simple classification accuracy using the **Perceptron** algorithm.

# Technologies Used
* **Python 3**
* **Scikit-Learn:** Used for model training (`KMeans`, `Perceptron`) and preprocessing (`StandardScaler`).
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and matrix operations.
* **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.

# Analysis Summary
1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Feature scaling was applied using `StandardScaler` to normalize the data distributions.
2.  **Clustering:** The Wine and Iris datasets were modeled using **K-Means** (k=3) and the clusters were visualized.
3.  **Classification:** A **Perceptron** model was trained, and accuracy scores were calculated on the test sets.

# Installation & Usage
```bash
# Install required libraries
